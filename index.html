    <h1>ENGLSISH</h1>
    <P>English is a West Germanic language of the Indo-European language family, originally spoken by the inhabitants of early medieval England.<br> It is named after the Angles, one of the ancient Germanic peoples that migrated from Anglia, a peninsula on the Baltic Sea (not to be confused with East Anglia in England), to the area of Great Britain later named after them: England.<br> The closest living relatives of English include Scots, followed by the Low Saxon and Frisian languages.<br> While English is genealogically West Germanic, its vocabulary is also distinctively influenced by Old Norman French and Latin, as well as by Old Norse (a North Germanic language).<br>Speakers of English are called Anglophones.</P>
